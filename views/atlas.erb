    Sharing maps on MindMup is great for co-creating and editing, but requires authors to worry about assigning privileges to co-authors and
    presents a full-blown editor interface. Mindmup Atlas  makes it much easier to share the content with the world, when you just want to publish
    and not co-edit with the audience. With just a few clicks, share your maps with the world and engage the readers using interactive mind maps.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    MindMup Atlas is a cloud mind map library that enables authors to publish interactive, read-only versions of their maps, optimised for posting to social networks,
    including into web sites and search engine indexing.

    <h2>Engage your audience with interactive mind maps</h2>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Instead of generating a static image or a PDF, publish interactive maps that your audience can engage with. Make large
    maps easy to work with by collapsing nodes and your readers can open them as they want. Connect your content with articles and 
    resources online by adding links, and your readers will be able to just click on them to see more information. Provide in-depth rich-text content for
    your ideas using attachments, and your readers will be able to view them with one click.

    <h2>Easily integrate maps into your blog or web site</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>When you publish a map to MindMup Atlas, you can easily include it in your web site or blog as an Iframe.
    This means you can now publish maps on Google Sites, Wordpress blogs, Thumblr and other link sharing sites.</p>
    <p>You can also host the map yourself. Atlas maps are self-contained HTML files, so you can easily download
    the web page and publish under your own domain.</p>
    <p>We automatically generate nice thumbnails you can use on sites that do not support embedding, so you can
    post an image and link to the interactive map.</p>
    <p>Atlas maps adjust to users' browsers and capabilities. People accessing on very old browsers will see a static image. People accessing
    with browsers that do not support a full range of interactivity will see a static HTML page and be able to move around. Readers with modern browsers
    will be able to fully engage with your content.</p>
