    <h2>Engage your audience with interactive mind maps</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>Instead of generating a static image or a PDF, publish interactive maps that your audience can engage with. Make large
    maps easy to work with by collapsing nodes and your readers can open them as they want. Connect your content with articles and
    resources online by adding links, and your readers will be able to just click on them to see more information. Provide in-depth rich-text content for
    your ideas using attachments, and your readers will be able to view them with one click.

    <h2>Get visibility on social networks</h2>
    <p>For authors that want to publish maps to social networks, Atlas makes it
    hassle-free. We automatically add images and contextual information to
    ensure that your maps show up nicely on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and
    Pinterest, and provide automatically generated thumbnails for other sites
    to display with the text.</p>
    <% if false then %>
    <p>You can ensure that your content is more visible on social networks by
    adding social voting widgets to your maps, and allow readers to easily
    re-post or vote for your maps on popular social networks.  Atlas makes
    adding widgets as simple as clicking on checkboxes. </p>

    <h2>Drive traffic to your web site</h2>
    <p>Include links to your blog, personal profiles on social networks, and drive audience to your web sites through maps published on Atlas.
    We take care of all the hassle of setting up connection widgets and loading the right set of scripts &nbsp; all you need to do is tick
    a few check-boxes</p>
    <p>We automatically optimise published content for search engines, providing an easy way for Google to discover and index the contents
    of your maps. You can also control the title and other important meta-tags for search engine information, to ensure that your maps
    display nicely in search results.

    <h2>Easily integrate maps into your blog or web site</h2>
    <p>When you publish a map to MindMup Atlas, you can easily include it in your web site or blog as an iframe.
    This means you can now publish maps on Google Sites, Blogger and other link sharing sites.</p>
    <p>You can also download the entire archive and host the map yourself. Atlas maps are self-contained HTML files, so you can easily modify the page
    to include additional widgets and publish under your own domain.</p>
    <p>We automatically generate nice thumbnails you can use on sites that do not support embedding, so you can
    post an image and link to the interactive map.</p>
    <p>Atlas maps adjust to users' browsers and capabilities. People accessing on very old browsers will see a static image. People accessing
    with browsers that do not support a full range of interactivity will see a static HTML page and be able to move around. Readers with modern browsers
    will be able to fully engage with your content.</p>
