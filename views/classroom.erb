          <h2>Get started easily</h2>

          without needing instructions and help from a teacher. MindMup for Hangouts is trivially easy to get started with, so you'll

          <p>Because we're utilising the Hangouts infrastructure, collaboration comes free and out of the box. Comments, chat, even video collaboration

          in mind maps at the touch of a button. They can link to other GAFE documents easily from nodes. Finally, students can share and transfer maps to Google Drive after group work. </p>
