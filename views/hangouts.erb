    MindMup for Hangouts puts mind mapping capabilities into one
    of the best collaboration systems out there!    
    You get all
    the productivity of MindMup, all the goodness of visual and audio conversations,  but without the hassle of 
    managing collaboration over multiple channels. Lightning-fast idea
    capture? Check!
    See people's faces as you discuss ideas? Check!
    Global access? Check! 
    Waste time setting up privileges and document
    sharing? Of course not. Keep pulling people in and out of 
    video conversations just to explain an idea? No more!

    <p>
    Most online mind mapping tools first focused on mapping capabilities, then
    built collaboration on top of that. The result was clunky and severely
    limited. Almost any good online mind mapping tool today offers concurrent editing, 
    but the conversation part is far below what modern users expect.
    Chat systems are non existing or severely limited, there is no way to see
    collaborators faces or talk to them directly while mind mapping. For effective collaboration,
    groups had to set up a separate video or audio channel using Skype or
    Hangouts. Synchronising participants across two different channels, setting
    up resource permissions and managing presence just becomes a headache.
    Jumping out of the mind map to a screen share to discuss a presentation is
    a hassle. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, remote conversation tools aren't that good for visualising ideas. People often
    start talking online about something that seems simple at first, but then wished for a nice whiteboard to visualise
    the connections in their minds. This required interruption to set up a separate document in a different tool. Coordinating
    invitations and privilege lists disrupts conversations just when they become interesting. No more! 
    </p>
    <p>Instead of building collaboration on top of a mind
    mapping tool, we built mind mapping inside a great collaboration tool.

    <h2>Great for schools</h2>
    <p>Start collaborating with the entire classroom at a click of a mouse, and
    be safe in knowing that all your information is contained within the GAFE ecosystem.
    All images are uploaded and loaded from Google Drive, and
    all the map data is stored in the Hangout.</p>
    <p>
    You do not have to worry about students unintentionally publishing work to third parties or
    unauthorised access.

  <div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Great for teams</h2>
    <p>Run planning sessions, visualise progress on collaborative activities and keep a track of your projects
    without having to synchronise participants in multiple applications. Just invite people to a hangout, and that's it. </p>
    <p>Schedule an event using Google Calendar, and you'll have a permanent link to your Hangout
    for easy access to mind map information.

    <h2>Great for discussions</h2>
    <p>If you start just with a voice call, but need to visulise a more complex idea, no need to jump out into a different tool any more,
    send separate invitations and coordinate updates. Just tap the MindMup app icon in the Hangouts toolbar and you're all set!</p>
    <p>You don't have to worry about installing software on everyone's machine or any kind of access privilege lists</p>

    Concurrent updates across the globe are instantly visible to your collaborators, using Google's Hangout infrastructure.

    </p>
    <p>
    Of course, great collaboration needs more than just concurrent updates. To really benefit from a group mind-mapping session, people
    need to know what everyone else is thinking as well. With MindMup for Hangouts, we're coming as close to a physical presence as possible,
    by allowing you to hear and see collaborators, but also enssuring that you know what everyone else is doing around the map.
    </p>    
    <p>
    As people are moving around the map, you can see their profile photos move and follow their thoughts. When your colleagues
    add new ideas or update map nodes, you'll get a quick overview with pop-up speech bubbles. This ambiental information makes
    groupwork much more powerful than just remote simultaneous document editing. 
    <p>
    <p>
    A map stays associated with the hangout, so you can leave at any time and come back, and your ideas will wait for you.

    <h2>Free, unlimited collaboration</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
    Free as in beer. MindMup does not limit the number of maps, concurrent Hangouts or people you can involve. Even better, it's opensource. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Also free as in speech. The data is yours, and you can take it out at any time. Transfer it to Google Drive with a single click, and
    then continue working on your map offline, or on a mobile device. MindMup maps can also be converted into Freemind easily,
    so you can import them into pretty much any other mapping tool.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, free as a bird. Once you're finished with the collaboration, publish it
    using MindMup Atlas, without the need to worry about security or forcing readers
    to install any particular software.
    Atlas will serve a read-only copy of your map to the world, that you can easily share or embed in your web site, and
    it even works well with popular social networks to help you get more visibility and engagement.

    MindMup for Hangouts uses the same mind mapping canvas as the main MindMup application, but simplified to fit in with the high-bandwidth
    communication provided by Hangouts. We removed all the noise so you can focus on your ideas, not on toolbars and menus. 
    You can still use powerful keyboard shortcuts
    to capture ideas quickly, and access common node operations from the convenient spider menu in the top-right corner. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    To print the map, convert it into an image, or to get the extra features of MindMup storyboards or measurements, 
    transfer
    it from a Hangout to your Google Drive with a single click, then open it in the regular MindMup app.
