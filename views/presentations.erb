          <p class="lead">Mind maps are great for brainstorming and planning, but not that good for presenting. A great story
          has a beginning and an end, a sequence of thoughts, suspense and  carefully planned discovery of information.</p>
          <p class="lead">MindMup helps professional
          presenters bring their ideas to the audience better by bridging that gap. Use a frictionless planning canvas to capture and 
          organise your thoughts, and then put them into a powerful storyboard to turn a hierarchy of ideas into a sequence of slides.</p>

          <h2>Capture ideas easily</h2>
          <p>MindMup tries very hard to make idea capture as frictionless as possible. 
          Powerful keyboard shortcuts enable you to focus on presentation content instead of menus. Just drag images
          from your file system and drop on the nodes to add pictures to text.</p>

          <h2>Build a storyboard</h2>
          <p>Simply drag and drop mind map nodes to the storyboard pane to organise your presentation. Create bullet points easily by adding
          a node with its children into the storyboard.
          The storyboard automatically updates when you change node contents.

          <h2>Make beautiful slides</h2>
          <p>Turn the storyboard into beautiful PDF slides with just one click. MindMup will format node images and text into 4x3 aspect ratio slides
          that look great on all projectors, automatically choosing the best font size. Slides are vectors so they will also print nicely.</p>

          <h2>Export to Powerpoint</h2>
          <p>Export your storyboard to Powerpoint format with one click. Import that into your preferred presentation software to fine tune slide design, animate transitions, integrate into conference templates or add 
          anything that MindMup does not yet support. </p>

          <h2>Share slides easily</h2>
          <p>Share the presentation with your audience easily, as an online slide deck that will work nicely on desktop and mobile devices. Or, embed the slideshow
          into your web site easily.</p>

          <h2>Plan several versions</h2>
          <p>You can create several storyboards: one for the 15-minute version, one for the one hour conference keynote and one for the afternoon workshop. Update the node text once and all slides 
          magically change.</p>
